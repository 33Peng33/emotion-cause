1,not_clear,not_clear,Its really pretty but some things are not clear from advertisement/description.
2,null,null,the sink grill fish tank they show you in the ad all work as different components... 
3,null,null,when in fact they are one component and you have to change each item by attaching them onto this multiuse square sink/ dresser/ grill...
4,null,null,The grill is particularly more difficult to remove 
2 4
 (4,1)
1,null,null,When we received the package a small pink piece at the very top of the track that the elevator runs was actually broken
2,null,null,it actually acts as a stop to prevent the elevator from coming off the track when it reaches the top
3,null,null,and show our daughter where to stop when she gets to the top to prevent it from running off the track.
4,fun,fun,All these things aside it is still a big barbie house and can provide lots of fun for many barbies at a time

1,love,love,My niece absolutely loved the house and she went to bed late
2,null,null,because she was all into playing with it.
3,null,null,I suggest you get a second person to help.
4,null,null,There are a lot of small parts to the house. 
5,null,null,You only need 3 triple A batteries for one part of the house and the rest of it 
6,null,null,just requires snapping the correct parts together.
7,null,null,The toilet makes a flushing sound and there is a fan that blows air.
8,null,null,Totally a pass down to generation type of house if treated right by the owner.
5 5
 (1,2),(4,5)
1,not_hard,not_hard,The house wasn't hard to put together 
2,null,null,because it was partially assembled in the box. 
3,null,null,Only a few snaps and we were on our way. 
4,large,large,This dollhouse is much larger than the ones I had as little girl.
5,null,null,My daughter is four and she has to stand up to reach the top floor. 
6 3
 (1,2),(1,3)
1,worried,worried,I was worried about ordering this
2,null,null,because of the reviews I read regarding the elevator not working
3,null,null,but so far so good over here.
7 6
 (5,4)
1,null,null,My daughter plays with it daily 
2,null,null,and even with her big brothers shooting 
3,null,null,the elevator up and down it is still in perfect condition.
4,null,null,The garage door is hard to maneuver 
5,frustrated,frustrated,and my daughter does get frustrated with it at times
6,null,null,but I haven't had any issues with it coming off.
8 3
 (1,2)
1,impressed,imporessed,I am also impressed 
2,null,null,with the number of accessories that came with her house.
3,null,null,I would definitely recommend for any small girl.
9 11
 (1,5)
1,5_star,5_star,I would definitely give this a 5 star if the elevator pulley worked. 
2,null,null,I showed my daughter how to play with the garage door carefully
3,null,null,since I noticed it does not like to stay on the track.
4,null,null,I also showed her how to carefully move the elevator 
5,null,null,since the pulley system is cheap.
6,null,null,She played with it for 30 minutes and then went to bed.
7,null,null,The next day the elevator broke down
8,null,null,and I had to go in and figure it out.
9,null,null,I fixed it.
10,null,null,It had to go all the way up then down to let the line out. 
11,null,null,Next day it just stopped pulling all together as it kept getting caught up in the track. 
10 6
 (1,2),(1,3)
1,3_star,3_star,I gave 3 star
2,null,null,because of the ease in set up and over all it looks good and does not fall apart like a lot of stuff.
3,null,null,But the moving parts I am dissatisfied with. 
4,null,null,I admit I could have returned it
5,null,null,but it was her birthday gift 
6,null,null,and I didn't have the heart to take it from her
11 9
 (7,5)
1,null,null,Your little princess will love this! 
2,null,null,I say that jokingly having had to put it together.
3,null,null,It comes in a thousand pieces
4,null,null,but the first two floors come together already. 
5,null,null,There is a very detailed step-by-step poster that you get in the Box.
6,null,null,While the instructions are not written
7,easy,easy,they are pictured, and easy to follow if you go step by step.
8,null,null,It did take me two hours to put it together
9,null,null,and that includes putting all of the little toothbrushes ovenware and table settings
12 5
 (1,2)
1,cute,cute,too cute
2,null,null,It has the sounds of a flushable toilet
3,null,null,it has a fan that works, 
4,null,null,a sink with running water sounds and tooth brushing sounds
5,null,null,as well as an aquarium that turns. 
13 5
 (1,3)
1,play,play,Our granddaughter has spent countless hours playing with her Barbie Dream House.
2,null,null,She keeps her Barbie boat in the garage
3,null,null,and she enjoys having her Barbies go up and down the elevator
4,null,null,the hours that you spent putting it together will be well worth it 
5,null,null,since there are many many many more hours of playtime.

 (1,5)
1,great,great,The house is great
2,null,null,but two parts had rips in it when we bought it
3,null,null.and the toilet was broken with two missing parts.
4,null,null,This is bad because the toilet was supposed to make flushing sounds.
5,null,null,the house has so many fun features.

 (3,1)
1,null,null,She loves the garage and her favorite accessorie is the sink 
2,null,null,she is able to switch the top.
3,recommend,recommend,Definitely recommend it, specially for the Barbie lovers
23 5
 (1,4)
1,love,love,I love it because my daughter loves it
2,null,null,This was the big ticket Christmas item, 
3,null,null,and boy was it a huge hit 
4,null,null,It took a bit to put together, but that was super fun to do with my daughter.
5,null,null,She was able to participate and we spent all day Christmas assembling it  and playing house.
24 6
 (3,1),(3,2)
1,null,null,The elevator works great, the garage manually goes up and down,
2,null,null,and the window turns into a pool on the side of the garage. 
3,sweet,sweet,All in all this thing is pretty sweet,
4,null,null,tons of things to do to occupy the mind. 
5,null,null,My daughter is actually using it with her Monster High dolls
6,null,null,and it's a perfect fit!
25 2
 (1,2)
1,sweet,sweet,Elevator is pretty sweet
2,null,null,my 5 year old can operate it with ease.
26 4
 (2,1)
1,null,null,Instructions included were very clear
2,easy,easy, made the assembly easy
3,null,null,It comes with all sorts of tiny little pieces like kitchen items, food and drink items, etc. 
4,null,null,There is a ton of this stuff!  
27 4
 (4,3)
1,null,null,Although it was very easy to assemble 
2,null,null,the process one of the front pillars broke. 
3,null,null,Within one week the garage door was broke the elevator has always stuck and never worked great. 
4,flimsy,flimsy,The house is very flimsy and cheaply built.
28 5
 (5,4)
1,null,null,We bought this for our daughter for Christmas. 
2,null,null,This is the only thing she asked for 
3,null,null,and as soon as she saw it we knew it was the right choice.
4,null,null,It did need to be put together and is large
5,surprise,surprise,if you want to surprise them with it together.
29 6
 (1,2)
1,love,love,She loved it. 
2,null,null,it was the only thing she asked for, for her Birthday. 
3,null,null,The only hiccup I've run into so far is the elevator comes off its track sometimes.
4,null,null,When that happens I need to pop out two screws 
5,null,null,and run the cord that acts as the lift mechanism back into its respective gears
6,null,null,Outside of that she's never had a complaint and plays with it every day.
30 4
 (3,1),(3,4)
1,fabulous,fabulous,This dream house is just so fabulous
2,null,null,I bought it for my daughter's 7 birthday
3,happy,happy,and she is more than happy
4,null,null,She can play there for hours just creating stories with her dolls and little stuff that comes with it are beautiful and well done.
31 5
 (5,4)
1,null,null,Knowing that Amazon has a better return policy
2,null,null,I ordered a new Dream house with the pasted on photos of what the Dream house should look like. 
3,null,null,The price was down to $150
4,null,null,There was an option that you could order a plain box with no markings. 
5,suspicious,suspicious,That seemed risky and suspicious to me. 
32 8
 (1,2),(1,5)
1,complain,complain,My complaints
2,null,null,it seemed like this may have been a returned item
3,null,null,the way the pieces were just thrown in the box, 
4,null,null,not all of them in plastic; a broken piece dirt smudges on one of the floors
5,null,null,There is a little bit of false advertising
6,null,null,on the box they make it look like the fish tank can be snapped onto a windowsill
7,null,null,and it can't- it can only be attached to the top of the bathroom sink
8,null,null,and it's supposed to turn but it doesn't.
33 3
 (3,1)
1,null,null,Easily assembled
2,null,null,but they don't clearly explained where to stick the stickers. 
3,good,good,Overall good toy
34 7
 (1,5)
1,love,love,My 7 year old daughter absolutely loves this. 
2,null,null,Her favorite thing is the table that makes noise and lights up 
3,null,null,depending on what attachment you put on it 
4,null,null,there's a sink a fish tank, a fan, etc.
5,null,null,She loves putting the barbies in the elevator and loves the closet in the bedroom
6,null,null,but it is definitely not big enough to hang all the clothes she owns, 
7,null,null,probably enough space for 7 pieces.
35 8
 (6,7)
1,null,null,The garage door goes up and down and fits a Barbie car she already had
2,null,null,and there's a swimming pool on the side that comes down.
3,null,null,You can also put a smart phone in the TV screen for the living room
4,null,null,but my Samsung Galaxy didn't fit.
5,null,null,It's ok,  I'd rather have her play with the house than watch on my phone.
6,great,great,Overall, a great buy 
7,null,null,since it provides hours of entertainment. 
8,null,null,We've had it for 3 months and nothing has broken or stopped working.
36 10
 (1,2)
1,love,love,My daughter absolutely LOVES this house.
2,null,null,it is big, but does not take up her whole room, which I love It comes with all the furniture accessories pictured. 
3,null,null,My daughter loves the interchangeable tops to the electronic console
4,null,null,and letting her barbies watch TV on my Ipod. 
5,null,null,I'll admit I thought that feature was gimmicky
6,null,null,but its one of the features she actually uses regularly.
7,null,null,We previously had one of the kid-kraft wooded doll houses
8,null,null,but they really lacked in the details 
9,null,null,more of a large box with just stickers
10,null,null,and a few pieces of chunky "furniture".
37 3
 (1,2)
1,love,love,My daughter loves the small details here 
2,null,null,the shelving in the fridge to organize groceries the oven racks for cookies and baskets in the dishwasher to hold the silverware. 
3,Not to mention, the plastic will survive water.
38 8
 (1,2),(1,5)
1,5_star,5_star,My reasons for not giving 5 stars 
2,null,null,the garage door does stick come off the tracks easily.
3,null,null,This is not a problem
4,null,null,but I did have to teach her several times how to unstick it gently.
5,null,null,Also, the roof fronts are cardboard which is really annoying. 
6,null,null,I may take them out and laminate them 
7,null,null, or find a way to make them more durable. 
8,null,null,The durability of the elevator makes me nervous
39 5
 (2,1)
1,null,null,Overall the house goes together quickly and easily 
2,recommend,recommend,I recommend the barbie house
3,null,null,under 30 minutes from beginning to end. 
4,null,null,The garage is a bit small for some cars 
5,null,null,but fits the glam convertible perfectly. 
40 7
 (7,3)
1,null,null,why I am not docking stars for this issue  was delivery.
2,null,null,My house came 
3,null,null,and had several broken missing pieces it looked like a previously returned item that had not been fully checked over.
4,null,null,Also I had requested the item to ship in an amazon box
5,null,null,and it still came in just the original packaging. 
6,null,null,My daughter opened the door and unfortunately saw the gift before we could stop her. 
7,upset,upset,I'm still upset at that one
41 4
 (1,2)
1,believe,believe,I believe this is more so intended for older girls who are interested in barbies
2,null,null,because of all the small pieces
3,null,null,my three year old who has lost many of the tiny pieces
4,null,null,but it I understand it wouldn't be sensible to make them much larger.
42 3
 (1,2)
1,complaint,complaint,The only real complaint
2,null,null,that I have is that it the furniture, balcony, front door and pillars are very flimsy plastic 
3,null,null,and I don't see this house lasting long even with kids who are very careful and gentle with toys. 
43 6
 (1,5)
1,gorgeous,gorgeous,It is gorgeous. 
2,null,null,Shipping was great came rite on time. 
3,null,null,Only thing she can not keep it organized lol 
4,null,null,but it wonderful plays with her cousin all the time 
5,null,null,it a very large house and instruction was derailed all the pieces were intact
6,null,null,was a wonderful Christmas present for my autistic daughte
44 5
 (2,1)
1,null,null,that is on the spectrum but she is highly functuit teaches her a lot 
2,recommend,recommend,I will recommend this product to every child and adult 
3,null,null,as I as well spend time playing doll house with her. 
4,null,null,I wounder was is for her or for me hmmm 
5,null,null,thank you amazon.
45 7
 (2,7)
1,null,null,Got this for my little sister for Christmas.
2,love,love,She LOVES it. 
3,null,null,It didn't take much time to put this bad boy together. 
4,null,null,Maybe 20 minutes?
5,null,null,It would most likely take anyone else about 10 minutes 
6,null,null,since the 2 grown men putting it together refused to look at the instructions.
7,null,null, your Barbies can have cake strawberries smoothies and a whole chicken.
46 7
 (1,4),(1,7)
1,3_star,3_star,I gave 3 stars
2,null,null,We bought this for our 3 year old.
3,null,null,It took 30-45 minutes to put together.
4,null,null,the instructions very short and simple.
5,null,null,There's not a lot to mess up while putting this together as the pieces are
6,null,null,and we only glanced at the instructions a few times while putting this together. 
7,null,null,The only thing we struggled with is the elevator. 
47 5
 (4,1)
1,null,null,he house comes with plenty of accessories and by switching out the table top accessories, it makes plenty of different sounds. 
2,null,null,I would recommend picking up the Glam Convertible as well. 
3,null,null,I would recommend gluing on the mirrors though as they fall off pretty easy. 
4,favorite,favorite,This was by far my daughters favorite christmas present 
5,null,null,and she has played with it almost non stop.
48 5
 (1,4),(1,5)
1,love,love,let me say that I love this
2,null,null,I think I bought this more for myself than my daughter. 
3,null,null,But let me get to the best part. 
4,null,null,The packaging was great but there were LOTS of small pieces. 
5,null,null,It was also super easy to assemble and even more fun to play with!
49 5
 (3,4)
1,null,null,This thing is big! 
2,null,null,I purchased as a birthday present for my daughter
3,love,love but all kids love playing with it. 
4,null,null,The elevator is a hit Took an hour or so to put together but the fun is endless. 
5,null,null,Only concern is the tiny little accessories that get scattered and become a choking hazard for little ones.
50 3
 (1,3)
1,happy,happy,Well worth it, my granddaughter is very happy with her dollhouse.
2,null,null,This is one of the first toys that I've seen her really take care of. 
3,null,null,She loves how big it is and all the amenities that comes along with it.

 (2,3)
1,null,null,My daughter was ecstatic to finally get her own Barbie Dreamhouse
2,awesome,awesome,and this one is definitely awesome!! 
3,null,null,It is 3 stories and has 7 different rooms. 
52 2
 (1,2)
1,awesome,awesome,this one is definitely awesome!! 
2,null,null,It offers a play space of 4 feet tall and more than 3 feet wide!
53 3
 (3,1)
1,null,null,It has a working elevator, and garage door.
2,null,null,It also has 5 different interactive pieces such as a spinning fan and flaming stove top grill.
3,awesome,awesome,this one is definitely awesome!!
54 6
 (6,1)
1,null,null,The rooms are all decorated nicely and offer very modern decor for a Barbie world. 
2,null,null,You can set up your smartphone in the tv slot in the living room to make the tv come to life.
3,null,null,You will need AAA batteries for the interactive parts.
4,null,null,It took us about 45 minutes to get it put together. 
5,null,null,Since this item is so big it does ship in the original box...
6,awesome,awesome,all in all this one is definitely awesome!! 
55 6
 (6,1),(6,5)
1,null,null,The house is very nice. My daughter loves playing with it.
2,null,null,My only issue is that the elevator broke the same day she started playing with it 
2,null,null,and the garage door will not stay in place 
3,null,null,the handle that keeps it in place keeps falling off.
4,null,null,For $200 I wish it would work properly.
5,null,null,I will say it has some cool features like the ability to use your cell phone as the flat screen TV. 
6,good,good,All and all, good purchase.
56 5
 (5,1)
1,null,null,This thing is massive and very detailed. 
2,null,null,I put it together for Christmas 
3,null,null,and my adult self was totally jealous of having such a wonderful Barbie dream house!!
4,null,null,Where was this when I was little??
5,love,love, I do love it
57 4
 (1,2)
1,complaint,complaint,my complaint
2,null,null,the door on the garage is easy to come off
3,null,null, it's tracks and I spend some time fixing that.
4,null,null,Expect to spend an hour putting it together.
58 4
 (1,2),(1,3),(1,4)
1,happy,happy,Overall, super happy with the product.
2,null,null,Furniture is cute and elevator is a big hit with the girls. 
3,null,null,Bathroom had sounds for a fan, toilet, running water and fish tank.
4,null,null,maybe a working doorbell would be the next addition to the super awesome pad!!
59 8
 (6,1)
1,null,null,It's cool! I'll acknowledge that! 
2,null,null,Garage oven door elevator and its doors..they come off so easily! 
3,null,null,Within the first week we were fixing it all the time.
4,null,null,That being said... my five year old couldn't care less if the garage or elevator is jammed up
5,null,null,She doesn't care one bit if there's no oven door on.
6,love,love,She plays with it every day! And she loves it! 
7,null,null,Every couple of weeks I sit down and set it all back up properly
8,null,null,down to every feature and I love doing it
60 2
 (1,2)
1,best,best,Best birthday present ever for my 4 years daughter.
2,null,null,The house is amazing and was easy put it together.
61 5
 (4,3),(4,5)
1,null,null,Bought this for my daughters 3rd birthday which was 3 months ago
2,null,null,she lived it and still plays with it daily even my two older boys play with it with her.
3,null,null,Assembly was very easy and everything just snapped together.
4,4_star,4_star,Only 4 stars 
5,null,null,because the elevator and garage door fall off a little to easy but they go right back on without a problem
62 9
 (1,4)
1,excited,excited,I was over the moon excited for my 3 year old to receive her first Barbie Dream house.
2,null,null,I'm glad we kept it. 
3,null,null,It was the 2013 edition that opens up on the middle to create more room.
4,null,null,It's perfect for her and her Barbie dolls. 
5,null,null,She didn't need another pool anyway. 
6,null,null,She has one on the camper and a glam Barbie pool.
7,null,null,The garage is no big deal either. 
8,null,null,I'm giving it 5 stars for the great mistake 
9,null,null,Amazon made by sending the wrong doll house. 
63 3
 (1,2)
1,love,love,My daughter loves this
2,null,null,it was relatively easy to assemble 
3,null,null,other than the garage door and the elevator... 
64 4
 (1,2)
1,perplex,perplex,I'm perplexed  
2,null,null,the dresser if you choose to flip it around and take the sink off to add the fan/tank then you have no sink in the bathroom.
3,null,null,It would have made MUCH more sense to include 2 of them
4,null,null,I didn't even bother to show my daughter that they were interchangeable.
65 9
 (1,2)
1,0_star.0_star,Would have given it 0 stars if I could.  
2,null,null,Straight out the box there was broken parts the elevator was also 
broken.  
3,null,null,There a string that is connected with the elevator.
4,null,null,Stupid ideal for anyone who came up with an ideal to use a string to operate the elevator. 
5,null,null,The string was out of place and the elevator would no longer go up or down.  
6,null,null,When putting this house together for my child Parts begin to snap off.  
7,null,null,The amount of pieces that came in the box is to small for the box itself.
8,null,null,Everything is all bunch up.  
9,null,null,Conclusion. Avoid this product or wait for a price drop.
66 7
 (7,1)
1,null,null,My daughter loves it so much! Pink , fab , fun... she likes every part of it!
2,null,null,It's not available in our country (Philippines)
3,null,null,so she had to wait for 1 1/2 months for this.
4,null,null,Her reaction upon seeing its box was priceless. 
5,null,null,It was all worth it! 
6,null,null,I'm Also glad that everything's working and that there were no missing pieces.
7,happy,happy,Our princess is happy, and so we are more than happy!!
67 4
 (2,1)
1,null,null,Over all my daughter loves this 
2,happy,happy,I am happy with it. 
3,null,null,I was very cautious with assembly
4,null,null,so the pieces wouldn't break.
68 8
 (6,7)
1,null,null,My 6 yr old daughter was desperately asking for this Barbie Dream house for Christmas
2,null,null,but she already had the 1st Barbie dream house that came out about 3 yrs ago.
3,null,null,So after much deliberation and review reading, 
4,null,null,I decided to upgrade her and get this one......  
5,null,null,it truly was an upgrade for a big 6 yr
6,enjoy,enjoy,I'm so glad I did and even my almost 8 yr old niece enjoys it as well
7,null,null,It is slightly taller than her also it has so many accessories big and small and the pool
8,null,null,garage are an added bonus.

2,fun,fun,My wife and I had fun doing it and the instructions are well laid out and easy to follow
3,null,null,I suggest using some superglue when attaching the pieces 
4,null,null,to make sure the house is solid and one piece. 
5,null,null,The last thing I want is this to be a pile of parts after a few months of rough playing by my girls.

3,null,null,However I am not sure if the missing battery door was the fault of

1,junk,junk,This product is plastic JUNK. It is VERY misleading

6,null,null,Huge fail here
154 6
 (1,2),(1,4)
1,issue,issue,The only 2 issues we've had
2,null,null,was that my daughter had problems operating the garage door 
3,null,null,since it came off the track once or twice
4,null,null,The other issue is that it's very limited with the type of phone you can fit into the flat panel TV holder
5,null,null,They could have made it bigger since modern phones are way bigger than they used to be
6,null,null,That's a small issue but it could have easily been addressed
155 8
